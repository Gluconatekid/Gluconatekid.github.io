<h3 class="room">Welcome to my software projects!</h3>

<p>
All of the projects on this website are my own work, including the images. On the navigation bar above, you can see the projects are organized 
into three categories: graphical user interface (GUI), console output, and web. Both the GUI and console projects were written and run using the Netbeans 
IDE. The text editor I used for this website, the quiz and the art gallery was Notepad++. By hovering the navigation bar above, you can access pages to see explanations and code for the following projects:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A GUI Java application for to do lists and goal setting (written in Java & JavaFX)</li>
    <li>A quiz on the American Revolution that calculates your score (written in HTML5, CSS & Javacript)</li>
    <li>An art gallery displaying some of my art (written in HTML5 and CSS)</li>
	<li>A console output program that calculates your shopping bill (written in Java)</li>
    <li>A console output program that estimates the cost of building roads and bridges (written in C++)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Obviously, putting this website together was another project; bigger than I'd expected. This page was written in HTML5 and CSS. 
I published this website using GitHub.
</p>
</br>

<h3>Current Projects</h3>

<p>
I also have several projects that are in the process of being created, which I may include on this website in the future. Some of these unfinished projects 
include an inventory management system in Java, a matching game in Java, a student information system in C++, and other web pages to show off some of my 
construction projects, auto repairs, and teaching materials I have created.
</p>
</br>

<h3>Learning the Skill</h3>

<p>
Over the last year, I have been able to acquire basic programming skills in Java, C++, SQL, HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. I have learned this knowledge and skill 
from a variety of sources, including university computer science courses, free online classes, numerous tutorials, and books. Using one tutorial, I made a Tic Tac 
Toe game using Java Swing. However, it wasn’t my own work, so I didn’t feel like I could include it here. 
</p>

<p>
I hope that you enjoyed learning about my projects as much as I have enjoyed making them!
